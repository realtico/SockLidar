# Unix-Sockets based kit for Lidar M1C1 Mini
"Driver" and Graphical interface for a chinese cheap lidar, currently for Linux/Unix/WSL

This program utilizes a *C*-coded serial reader and *pygame*-based graphical view of the lidar output. The lidar used was purchased on AliExpress (https://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/0.html?spm=a2g0o.9042647.6.2.559e37a1jYP0hF&orderId=8133980903635463&productId=4000251359842) and has an 8m range which is pretty good. 

This is my own development and it was based on a chinese datasheet which I translated to Brazilian Portuguese using Google Translate, since the english version on AliExpress site was incomplete. 

The main points in this code is to use C for a very fast serial reading and Unix-Sockets to connect to a pygame based interface, which is simple to modify and understand yet beautiful. This driver is faster since it will only provide the last dataframe when invoked. It also allows connection to systems different from the visualization one

The Socket connection was developed using ChatGPT 4o. It felt like cheating but saved a lot of time coding so, if you are getting too old to dedicate a lot (and I mean a lot) of time debugging, give it a try! You still have to give guidelines and think about the logic of the code but the brick-laying work is done by your digital intern!

I'll work now on a Internet socket based kit to allow utilizing an heterogeneous architecture, with multiple OSs and computers sharing data!


## *DEPENDENCIES:* 

### Required Packages:
- **Python 3.7 or higher**

- **Pygame ≥ 2.1** (recommended: 2.6.1 for performance improvements)

- **SDL2 ≥ 2.0.9** (used internally by Pygame)

- **SDL2_ttf ≥ 2.0** (required for font rendering in Pygame)

- **fontconfig** (used by Pygame to locate system fonts)

Dependencies Install Instructions (Debian / Raspberry Pi OS):
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev fontconfig
pip3 install pygame
``` 

💡 On low-powered devices like Raspberry Pi Zero, precompiled versions of Pygame may not work properly. In this case, compiling Pygame from source is recommended.

The C code does not need any special package. The included makefile is pretty straightforward, so you don't forget the -lm option (it uses the math lib).
